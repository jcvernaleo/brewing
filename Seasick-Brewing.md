This whitepaper describes the challenges and possibilities of
boat-based (mostly) small scale brewing of beer.  It discusses the
motivations, open questions, and possible solutions.

## Introduction

Recent events have lead to an increased interest in gardening, self
sufficiency, DIY work, and similar from scratch persuits, beyond the
doomsday prepper sub-cultures they often interest.  The homebrewing
world has always had an interest in being as self contained as
possible combined with a very strong DIY ethic.  The combination of
these factors and a desire to leave life on land behind brings up the
possibility of water-born brewing.  This could be either ocean or lake
based.

## Possible Scales

For the proposes of this paper we will assume that there are three
size scales for brewing.  In reality there is much more of a continuum
but for simplicity three scales should illustrate things well enough.

Homebrew scale will be considered anything in the 2 to 10 gallon range per batch.

Microbrew is defined as anything larger than homebrew but not at an
industrial scale.  (insert more accurate amount).

Macrobrew is defined as brewing on what we can consider an industrial
scale.  It is unlikely that macrobrew can be done on a boat (unless
something on the scale of a cruise ship can be obtained).  This is not
seen as a major loss.

## Requirements

There are several basic requirements for brewing: water, grains,
yeast, hops and other additions, heat, and temperature controlled
space for fermenting.

Grains, yeast, hops and other additions are all easily procured on
land and may be stored relatively easily assuming basic refrigeration
for some of them.  None of this should be significantly different for
traditional brewing.

Water is a more complicated situation.  There are two uses of water in
brewing.  The first is simply that beer is composed mostly of water.
This means a source of high quality, fresh water is needed.  For
homebew size, 5-8 US Gallon batches this can be imported from land
without much trouble.

Anything larger than homebrew scale might further complicate importing
fresh water for an ocean-based boat brew.  With that said, the seemingly
limitless fresh water from Great Lakes offer a tempting alternative 
(though, with their own set of issues - particularly the rather 
harsh winters they withstand).  It's worth noting that water from
the Great Lakes is incredibly desireable for brew operations. 

The second use of water is as a thermal reservoir, generally to cool
the wort very quickly.  In this case, brewing on a boat provides
several new options as there is an effectively limitless thermal
resevious in the ocean or lake (assuming we are not talking about
industrial scale brewing).

The next major issue is heating the water.  To brew a large amount of
water must be boiling or otherwise heating in a controlled way.  This
would most likely have to be done with propane heaters unless some
other source of heating was available on the vessel. 

On the heating note, the authors of thispaper, while lacking any formal
nautical training, are accomplished scroungers and interested in 
utilizing "wasted" energy.  There may be some potential to utilize
the "waste" heat generated by the boat's engine room in assisting (not
driving) the boiling or mashing process. More research is needed. 

## Challenges

There are a number of challenges this project would face - though
this should not mean it is not worthy of study and contemplation.  

### Scale

The authors have outlined their three definitions of brewing scale earlier 
in this whitepaper.  Acquisition costs, profits, and operational budgets may
severely limit the viability of smaller microbrewing boats. 

Homebrewers would likely not see much of an issue or change to their typical 
brewing process.  

Marco-, industrial brewing would require a vessel well-beyond the expertise
of the authors.  Tankers, cruiseships, or some other blue water merchant ship 
would likely be needed to properly service their targeted barrel volume(s).

The, likely, most viable boat-brewery would use a smaller sized merchant ship
or large oceanic tugboat as its brewery. (add more) 

### Stable/Consistent Brewing Conditions

(Humidity, temperature, and sloshing)

(Grain, hop, and yeast storage)

### Labor & Culture

(Offers the rather niche intersection for brewhouse workers, needing to be
sailors and brewers - or a larger workforce needed to fill these roles
seperately)

(It would be worth putting down our business culture requirements in writing
to reference.  This may include leadership structure, decision making and 
equity offered to workers) 

### Flagship Brews 

#### Year-Round

Most successful breweries offer between 3-5 beers that are available
year-round.  Our Flagship Series (pardon the pun) should include at least:
1) lager, 2) IPA, 3) APA, and 4) stout.  This offers a flexible range while 
limiting the variables of a baseline operation. 

#### Seasonal

Additionally, we should offer 1-2 new beers per seasion, which leadership
can decide what makes the most sense given resources and industry trends.

### Revenue

(For this to work, it'd need to make some money)

#### Quality & Consistency

(The beer/beverages produced would need to be damn good
without calling attention to the boat)

#### Novelty & Experimentation

(As a boat-based brewery, we would need to be authorities
on the latest in the industy and how to offer unique 
experiences to our customers)

#### Fundraising & Loyalty

(We need people to initially invest in our idea and
leverage their connections to bring this thing to life - 
then retain those customers)

### Distribution & Packaging

#### Tap Room

One of the most profitable ways for a brewery to distribute its
product is a taproom.  The advantages are quite clear: kegs can be
reused, CO2 is abundant, and no middleman can take a cut. The 
maritime nature of boat-based brewing offers novel taproom potential.

Given size constraints, it is unlikely that such a brewery could host
the taproom on the actual brew-boat (or brew-barge).  This leaves two
options while staying thematically consistent: 1) a separate, docked 
taproom boat or 2) a more traditional taproom on a wharf or dock of
some type.  Noting here that "Scuttlebutt" and "The Tender" are just
some of the nautical themed names a taproom might adopt. 

#### Canning

(Canning)

#### Kegging

(Kegging)

#### Regions

As with all breweries, distribution would necessarily need to begin
on a smaller scale - potentially staying that way through the duration
of a given boat-brewery's life.  The ability to physically move the 
brewery, especially directly to ports, does offer a potentially 
interesting opportunity for wider distribution. 

### Legal
The authors of this paper offer no legal understanding of 
(inter)national alcohol regulations, outside of more obvious
and commonplace knowledge.  Literature outlining maritime brewing,
distillation (see below), or any other fermentation processes is 
lacking.

In addition to this glaring ambiguity, state laws (for US coastal brewing)
typically vary for the production, transportation, and consumption of
alcohol.

## Challenge Mitigations & Possible Solutions

(Possible solutions, or mitigations at least, to that which is outlined
in the previous section)

## Vessel requirements

(Largely depends on volume and scale)

## Limitations

(Challeneges outlined above, defining limitations as business, volume,
and so forth)

## Distilling

Distilling might also provide an interesting area for water-based
production.  It is important to note that generally speaking,
distilling is not legal in the United States and so this section is
for entertainment purposes only.  It is unclear to the authors the
legality of distilling in international waters.

Much like for brewing, the base ingredients would need to be procuded
on land.  This includes some form of fermintible sugar (potentially a
grain) and yeast.  All of these mirror the sitution for brewing.

The larger concern is running a still on a boat.  The motion of a boat
might produce problems which may require stabilization of the heating 
element or still-contents.  An overflow of the still onto the heating element
must be avoided at all costs.
