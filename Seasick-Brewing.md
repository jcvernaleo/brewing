# Seasick Brewing

This whitepaper describes the challenges and possibilities of
boat-based (mostly) small scale breeing of beer.  It discusses the
motivations, open questions, and possible solutions.

## Introduction

Recent events have lead to an increased interest in gardening, self
sufficiency, DIY work, and similar from scratch persuits, beyond the
doomsday prepper sub-cultures they often interest.  The homebrewing
world has always had an interest in being as self contained as
possible combined with a very strong DIY ethic.  The combination of
these factors and a desire to leave life on land behind brings up the
possibility of water-born brewing.  This could be either ocean or lake
based.

## Possible Scales

For the proposes of this paper we will assume that there are three
size scales for brewing.  In reality there is much more of a continuum
but for simplicity three scales should illustrate things well enough.

Homebrew scale will be considered anything in the 2 to 10 gallon range.

Microbrew is defined as anything larger than homebrew but not at an
industrial scale.  (insert more accurate amount).

Macrobrew is defined as brewing on what we can consider an industrial
scale.  It is unlikely that macrobrew can be done on a boat (unless
something on the scale of a cruise ship can be obtained).  This is not
seen as a major loss.

## Requirements

There are several basic requirements for brewing: water, grains,
yeast, hops and other additions, heat, and temperature controlled
space for fermenting.

Grains, yeast, hops and other additions are all easily procured on
land and may be stored relatively easily assuming basic refrigeration
for some of them.  None of this should be significantly different for
traditional brewing.

Water is a more complicated situation.  There are two uses of water in
brewing.  The first is simply that beer is composed mostly of water.
This means a source of high quality, fresh water is needed.  For
homebew size, 5-8 US Gallon batches this can be imported from land
without much trouble.

The second use of water is as a thermal reservoir, generally to cool
the wort very quickly.  In this case, brewing on a boat provides
several new options as there is an effectively limitless thermal
resevious in the ocean or lake (assuming we are not talking about
industrial scale brewing).

The next major issue is heating the water.  To brew a large amount of
water must be boiling or otherwise heating in a controlled way.  This
would most likely have to be done with propane heaters unless some
other source of heating was available on the vessel.

## Challenges

## Vessel requirements

## Limitations

## Distilling

Distilling might also provide an interesting area for water-based
production.  It is important to not that generally speaking,
distilling is not legal in the United States and so this section is
for entertainment purposes only.  It is unclear to the authors the
legality of distilling in international waters.

Much like for brewing, the base ingredients would need to be procuded
on land.  This includes some form of fermintible sugar (potentially a
grain) and yeast.  All of these mirror the sitution for brewing.

The larger concern is running a still on a boat.  The motion of a boat
might produce problems for that which would need to be worked around
somehow.
